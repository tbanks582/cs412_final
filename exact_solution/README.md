# Exact Solution to Longest Path NP-Complete Problem

to demonstrate the exact solution on your own machine:
- clone the repo
- from /cs412_final/,
- run ./run_test_cases.sh in a terminal

to modify what the value of k is for the connected graph, simply edit the number in connected_input.txt to desired k +1
to run on your own graph, replace exact_solution/connected_input.txt or execute:
- python exact_solution/exact_solution.py > output.txt
to feed custom graph via terminal

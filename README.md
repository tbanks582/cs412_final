longest path NP-Complete problem


input/output format:

The first line is the total flow of the network. Then, each edge that is part of the min cut is printed on a separate line. 
First line of the output has the cost of the longest path, and the second line prints the path itself.

sample input:
6 9 
0 1 20
0 2 10
1 2 10
1 3 5
3 2 15
2 4 10
4 3 10
3 5 15
4 5 20

sample output:
